Senior Project

Academic Portfolios are key for students to show their work and what they can bring to the table. Therefore, the look and accessibility of one are key. But an issue is the difficulty of making one. Most students would want to drop all of their information into one and then structure it from there. But in reality, students spend more time fixing the technical side of things; that they lose precious time in adding content and designing it to their style wants.  

For my senior project, a solution can be made. In collaboration with Joshua Olumese, we will be making two platforms to fix the same issue. For him, a website platform. And for me, a mobile application. Although sharing the same idea, both platforms will be built and worked on individually. In terms of branding and theme, the platforms will be the same. 

This dual collaboration is similar to the LinkedIn platform. You can use the same features on the website and app
